The purpose of this repo is to add all the AI models that I ran so far against electricity consumption data from Romania. 

The first objective is to create a benchmark for analyzing how different generations of models have improved when it comes to forecasting in the energy sector. 

The data is taken from the largest energy provider in romania, the data is either hourly or 15 minutes time interval. We are talking about electricity consumption at a national level
or OMEPA(the big consumers -factories, big infrastructure, etc) 

So far, based on the image bellow we can  see the intermediary results. The analysis is univariate for all the models that I ran.

The next models that will appear on the list are:
